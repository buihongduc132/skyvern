- Symptom: UI loads, but run "stream"/page progress never updates (stuck on "Starting the stream..." and/or backend unreachable).
- Root causes:
  - Local screenshot artifacts never wrote streaming PNG to `TEMP_PATH/{org}/{workflow_run_id}.png`, so WS stream had no frames.
  - Backend dev reload crashed when cwd included `postgres-data/pgdata` (permission denied), so API never came up.
  - Starting server from a different cwd broke `.env` discovery (settings defaulted to `PORT=8000`), mismatching the UI's API base.
- Fixes:
  - Write streaming PNG on screenshot artifact creation + persist via storage.
  - Start server from `./temp` but export `.env` vars so settings stay correct.
  - Load `.env` before settings import; avoid early settings import via analytics.
  - Ignore `postgres-data` during pytest discovery.
